# contract-generator

This software will generate a customized payment schedule based on patient's insurance information and expected time spent under care. The user will input patient information in the top form and the payment schedule will change based on this info. There will be a button to print to pdf so that pdf can be passed to signing software.

In the future:
Patient info will auto poplulate based on data fetched from a postgres database.
Possibly add signature feature.
